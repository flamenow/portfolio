            My name is Marcos Mujica, 24, born in Montevideo - Uruguay, living
            in Pelotas-RS, south of Brazil. I graduated in International Affairs
            in 2019 at the Federal University of Pelotas - UFPel.

            Since before the pandemic, I was already studying C, ladder,
            assembly and delphi at my electronic vocational training at IFSul,
            finished in 2018. In 2020 I joined Alura and started studiyng
            WebDesign, User Experience, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JAVA, PHP, RUBY
            and more. After getting to know a little about both sides of web
            development, I fell in love with UX and decided to focus in
            front-end and UX.

            {" "}
            It was then that I did the UX Unicorn course, offered by the known
            Leandro Rezende, where I formed a team and made a UX project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also lived 1 year in Gran Can√°ria-Spain (2010), oppened my own
            pizzaria (2021) and met amazing people in the process! Nowadays, I'm
            searching for a full time job working as front-end dev or ux
            designer. Meanwhile, I'm working as a freelancer web/graphic
            designer to a few companies.
