          <p>Hello everybody! Pleased to meet you ðŸ™‚</p>
          <p>
            I am Marcos Mujica, 24 years old. I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay,
            naturalized brazilian when I was a child, living now in Pelotas, Rio
            Grande do Sul. I graduated in International Relations in early 2020
            at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel).
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            {" "}
            Since before the pandemic, I was already studying C, Ladder,
            Assembly and Delphi at my Electronic Vocational Training at IFSul,
            which I finished in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I joined Alura and studied WebDesign, User Experience, CSS,
            HTML, JavaScript, JAVA, PHP, RUBY and more. After I got to know a
            little bit more about the two sides of web development, I fell in
            love with UX and decided to focus on it and on front-end
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was around that time that I did the UX Unicorn course, offered by
            the well-known UX designer Leandro Rezende. This was when I firmed a
            true passion for the field, formed a team and participated in a
            really cool UX project which I will never forget.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking a bit about the path that made me who I am: I lived a good
            portion of my life in Uruguay as well as in Gran CanÃ¡ria-Spain for a
            whole year. Also, inspired by the amazing culinary of my homeland
            (of which my father never lets me forget), I even opened my own
            uruguayan pizzaria, running the business and being a pizza maker!{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, while I work as a Freelancer Web/Graphic Designer to a few
            companies and make some voice-overs in Spanish, I am looking for a
            full time job to work as a Front-End Developer or UX Designer.
